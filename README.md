## Multitape Turing Machine Simulator

Syntax inspired by http://morphett.info/turing/turing.html

Still a very early version. First line in input file must be the number of tapes.

Comments in simulator programs are not implemented yet.

Current output method is temporary and will get messed up if you make it write lines longer than the terminal's width.

Simulation starts on state q0 and stops when a state starting with "halt" is reached.
